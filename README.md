# FAQ and discussions about ANiceMind
This repo is the place for FAQ and for any discussions about ANiceMind and its milieu which are not directly related to concrete code in the code repos.

Please use the **Issues** tab above to create new discussion topics (= new issues) or to search for existing discussions.

An english wiki with basic informations about ANiceMind will be created and fostered in the future here in GitHub. In the meantime please look into the [YouTube channel about ANiceMind](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClrJo59VFodiBeia6aF05GA). This channel an its videos are in German language right now, but you can use the realtime translation features in YouTube and the Google Translator.

We all can discuss here about themes and topics like:

- Basic ideas and concepts used for the rise and growth of ANiceMind (the ***milieu***)
- Architecture of the milieu
- Development environments, frameworks, platforms, programming languages, best practices, agile project management, TDD, tooling, etc.
- Interdisciplinary cooperation between multiple fields of research in informatics, engineering, natural sciences, humanities, etc.
- Philosophical, ethical and political questions (concerning a strong and **autonomous(!)** AI to save flora and fauna on our planet...)
- ...

Together with the discussions and their intent and content, we will establish a FAQ list, answering the most common questions newbies have in the context of ANiceMind.

Stay tuned...
